How to merge this patch

The patch is huge and difficult to maintain. Mostly due to development in trunk (master banch).
So what to do with it? My suggestion is to split the patch into several smaller patches. Each patch arises from the difference (git diff) between two branches.

1) master - get_finance_waytype
   Adds function get_finance_waytype() to some classes. The function is used for distinguishing of transport type of varios objects.
   This does not change game format.

2) get_fiance_waytype - money2012_patchset210construction_costs
   Adds new interface to class spieler_t used for accounting of construction costs by finance_waytype.
   This does not change game format.

3) others
