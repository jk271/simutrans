I am happy to announce release of simutrans with patch containing more detailed finance stats. 

RELEASE NOTES

r5955-rc3

The version r5955-rc3 does not include any new functionality. It incorporates only new code from trunk and several bug fixes. This version should be ready for playing or merge to trunk.

Savegame format of this revision is INCOMPATIBLE with previos versions. 
Incompatibility is caused by changes merged from trunk branch: Some new settings
parameter has been added. Ability to read older (older than 111.5 excl.) game 
version was not affected.
If you have played any older game release with money stats and you would like 
to continue with new binary, save game with old binary into older format 
(e.g. 111.0) and than load game with new binary (r5955-rc3).

Savegame version of money patch was changed from 111.5 (111005) to 111.6 (111006). Change was made due to code merged from trunk.


Thank for feedback!

Enjoy playing!
